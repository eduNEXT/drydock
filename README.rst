Drydock
=======

Drydock is an opinionated tool offering a set of Tutor plugins aiming to provide features that enhance the operation of OpenedX installations in Kubernetes. It is developed by `Edunext <https://www.edunext.co/>`_


- A set of Kubernetes Jobs that replace the current tutor jobs with `ArgoCD Sync Waves <https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/sync-waves/>`_ that allow for a more controlled deployment of openedx.
- A set of Kustomization overrides adding `ArgoCD Sync Waves <https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/sync-waves/>`_ annotations to needed additional resources such as debug, workers or hpa.
- Backup cronjobs that allow backup of the MySQL and MongoDB databases.
- Integration of New Relic monitoring
- Add flower deployment for Celery
- Add a custom nginx and cert-manager configuration
- Add a set of debug resources to help diagnose issues

Extra plugins added:

- A patch that allows for the tuning of celery workers via `DRYDOCK_ENABLE_CELERY_TUNING`
- Allows caddy to catch requests for multiple domains through `DRYDOCK_ENABLE_MULTITENANCY`
- Add scorm matcher to caddy through `DRYDOCK_ENABLE_SCORM`
- A patch that allows for the use of sentry via `DRYDOCK_ENABLE_SENTRY` and `DRYDOCK_SENTRY_DSN`
- Patch for cms and lms worker pods to allow pod probes and lifecycle to work properly. Enabled via `DRYDOCK_POD_LIFECYCLE`

Rationale
---------

This project is proposed as a possible way of creating a community maintained
reference for large openedx installation.
Sometimes the needs for customization in large instances of openedx goes
against the required simplicity in the configuration that the tutor project
strives for. In those cases, the solution is to create a tutor plugin that
allows for such advanced customization options.

This projects intends to fill that gap with a solution that should allow many
community members to collaborate in one repo on the heavy toll that is the
maintainance of openedx operations.
